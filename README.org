* Huh?
Palantiri acts as a proxy between Foundry and your software. It allows you to
access Foundry functionality and data from outside of Foundry.

** WebSockets
The primary way that browsers communicate with realtime services is WebSockets.

** JSONRPC
JSONRPC is a way to use JSON for calling functions in remote
services. By sending JSONRPC requests, your software can call functions in
Palantiri, accessing functionality and data.

** Reverse Proxy
Browsers cannot act as WebSocket servers. Only client functionality is
possible. That means Palantiri cannot listen for incomming connections from
your software.

Instead, you must listen for Palantiri. That means you must be running some
kind of WebSocket server. Once Palantiri connects to your server, you can send
it JSONRPC requests.

* What is the point?
If you want to control/automate Foundry from scripts, custom clients, Emacs,
whatever, then Palantiri gives you a standard straightforward way to do that.

Check out =fvtt.el= a Foundry integration with Emacs as an example of how
Palantiri can be used.
